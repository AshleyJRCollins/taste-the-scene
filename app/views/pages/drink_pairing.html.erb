            <p>Dark larger is the perfect match to food. This is a beer with notes of
            caramel and it has a perfect balance between fruitiness and rounded bitterness.</p>

            <p>High acidity and mineral notes in combination with fruity and tropical
            notes and finish makes this wine a fantastic pairing to food. You can't
            go wrong with food in general and this menu with this perfect Riesling!</p>
        <h2 class="alcohol-title">RED WINE</h2>

            <p>Spicy yet medium bodied. Based on the grape Sangiovese and made in the
            heart of Tuscany. A tip is to decant this wine in a carafe about an hour
            before it should be drunk as this makes the wine open up and show itself
            from it's absolute best sides.</p>
